Python - Almost a circle
This project is part of the Higher Level Programming curriculum (ALU). It implements a Base class along with Rectangle and Square classes that inherit from it, following an object-oriented approach in Python 3.

Description
Base: manages the id attribute for every future class, and provides serialization helpers (JSON, CSV).
Rectangle: represents a rectangle with width, height, x, y.
Square: represents a square, inheriting from Rectangle.
Requirements
Python 3.8+
PEP 8 style (pycodestyle)
All classes, methods, and functions must be documented and unit tested.
Usage
python3 -m unittest discover tests
pycodestyle models/ tests/
